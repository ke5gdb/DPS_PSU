# DPS Power Supply Units

This repository was established to host tidbits of code I've wrriten that interact with the DPS-1200FB (or similiar) series of power supplies. 

power_supply_munin is a Munin node plugin written in Python (depends on smbus2).

More information can be found on [my blog](http://www.thathamkid.com/blog/).
